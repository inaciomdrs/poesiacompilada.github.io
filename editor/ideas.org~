** pushAt()

*** Information

The /pushAt(p, w)/ receives two arguments:

1. *p* is the position where the text shall be inserted;
2. *w* is the text to be inserted.

pushAt inserts imediatly before the character specified by *p*.

The numbering used is the following:

0123456
#######

e.g.: starting from 0.

*** Examples

In the example below, each type of character belongs to a different
node.

###$$$!!!!

Now, lets do a few tests with the behaviour of the pushAt function.

**** pushAt(0, @)

Expected:

@###$$$!!!!

Algorithm:

Run through each text block until the starting position of one of them
is less or equal than the position to be inserted and the starting
position of the next one is not less than or equal than *p* and then
forward *p* - *starting position* and *w* to this block. After this, stop.

**** pushAt(1, @)

Expected:

#@##$$$!!!!

Algorithm:

*PASS*

**** pushAt(3, @)

Expected:

###@$$$!!!!

Algorithm:

*PASS*

Notes:

*w* will be inserted at the first position of the second block the first
block, not the last of the first one.
*** Algorithm

Run through each text block until the starting position of one of them
is less or equal than the position to be inserted and the starting
position of the next one is not less than or equal than *p* and then
forward *p* - *starting position* and *w* to this block. After this, stop.
